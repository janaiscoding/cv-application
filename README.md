# Jana's CV Application

## Project's Scope 

- The scope of this project was to build **my first application in React using Class components**.
- The actual practice was to understand how state and props work together, and how to create different render conditions.
- For example, each subsection takes user input but the Experience and Education field also have Add and Remove features to render again.
- I am postponing styling currently since I am planning to learn more about React and come back to re-make this using functional components.
